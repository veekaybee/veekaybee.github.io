Hi! I'm Vicki. I'm a [machine learning engineer at Mozilla.ai](https://blog.mozilla.ai/author/vicki/), working on LLMs and LLM infra.  I used to work at Duo, Tumblr, Automattic, and Comcast.  My interests in machine learning include [Recsys](https://vickiboykis.com/2021/10/28/recsys-2021-recap/) [search](https://boringml.com/docs/recsys/minhash/), [MLOps and production](https://vickiboykis.com/2020/06/09/getting-machine-learning-to-production/), and distributed systems. I like [reverse-engineering neural nets](https://gist.github.com/veekaybee/6f8885e9906aa9c5408ebe5c7e870698) and [machine learning systems.](https://vicki.substack.com/p/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about) 

My side project was [Viberary, which recommends you books based on vibe.](https://vickiboykis.com/2024/01/05/retro-on-viberary/)

I wrote a paper about [what embeddings are.](https://vickiboykis.com/what_are_embeddings/), `Embeddings Approaches DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.8015029`

I take notes on what I learn [here.](http://vickiboykis.com/ml-garden/) 

I once ran an ML/data conference called [Normconf.](https://normconf.com/)
