I [saw recently](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43332658) that YCombinator celebrated its 20th anniversary. 

[Hacker News is slightly younger](https://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html), but to me the two go hand in hand. 

As far as I can tell, I actively started reading Hacker News around 2011. I don't remember how I heard about it. It was probably on Reddit or Digg. Once I found it, I started reading every day, mostly because the comment sections were so full of smart people in tech.  

At the time I was working [as a data analyst](https://increment.com/planning/the-best-laid-plans-tech-careers/), mostly with SQL and Excel. I understood that I would need to learn much more to move into engineering, which I was getting excited about, but didn't quite understand how to bridge the gap. 

When I first started reading HN, I didn't understand 99% of the linked content, the jargon in the discussions, or the companies mentioned, but I was determined to learn. My general approach was to skim the top headlines and headlines that I could understand, read the post, and then read the HackerNews discussion. 

As I read the discussion, I would come upon terms I had no idea about: Big O notation, collaborative filtering, caching, Hindley-Milner type systems, lambda architectures, CI/CD pipelines, cryptography, generics, build or buy, B-trees, Bloom filters, trunk-based development, red/green deploys.  I would look all of them up and go down countless rabbit holes. 

HN is a bit bigger these days, but, thanks to contributors and the [tireless efforts of dang](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/the-lonely-work-of-moderating-hacker-news),  still so perfectly ambiently captures what tech is thinking about in the current moment. If you don't have a supportive community at work － like [many of us data scientists](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/2023/01/10/data-scientists-alone/) － HN was the perfect ambient watercooler to be near senior technically excellent people in the industry. 

In the first few years, I read maybe 2 links out of the 30 ever on the front page. But, because I read HN 4-5 times a day, after a few years, things started falling into place. 

[Other than constantly studying](https://vickiboykis.com/2022/11/10/how-i-learn-machine-learning/), Hacker News was one of the main things that pulled me up out of my bootstraps from a non-technical major afraid of SSHing into a server, to a person confidently [deploying code to millions of users](https://vickiboykis.com/2021/06/20/the-ritual-of-the-deploy/). There is only one other thing that has brought as much value to my career in tech, and that was the connections I made on old Twitter. 

Over time, I gained enough confidence to start blogging on technical topics, HN gave me something new: being aware that HN might pick apart that content forced me to learn to write clearly and precisely for a highly technical, educated audience. 

My favorite feeling is when, via a link, something I have written or created has made an impact on someone out there in the ether. Or, from the reader side, when I read something that makes me go "I'm not alone. This person has also thought about these problems," and I can't wait to see if there are any good discussions on the topic. 

YC is proud of the companies it launched:  Reddit, Airbnb, Instacart, Doordash, Stripe.  Ironically, the biggest multiples it's generated for the industry have been from a low-dazzle text forum written in Arc Lisp. 

Thank you for everything, HN.
